# Machine-Learning-Coursera
My submissions for Andrew Nguyen's coding assignments for his Machine Learning course on Coursera.

These folders contain my submissions for each machine learning assignment. I've put them here for my own ease of access and reference, but feel free to scrutinize my solutions.

Projects completed within the course:
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Logistic neural nets to recognize handwritten digits
- SVM spam classifier
- K-Means clustering for color compression
- PCA to reduce dataset dimensionality (whilst preserving variation in the dataset)
- Multivariate Gaussian Distribution to detect anomalies in a database
